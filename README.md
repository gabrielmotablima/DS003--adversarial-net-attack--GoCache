### Objectives:
  - Analize the server requests to discover anomalous activies.
  - Bring up insights about the server activities and possible adversarial attacks.
  - Propose actions to mitigate possible attacks.

### Results:
  - Estimated a upper threshold to specify a period as an adversarial attack period.
  - Bring up the understanding of the characteristics of an attack period.
  - Proposed for the next steps to mitigate future attacks.
